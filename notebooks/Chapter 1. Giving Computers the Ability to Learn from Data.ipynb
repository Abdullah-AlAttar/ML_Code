    "## Regression for predicting continuous outcomes\n",
    "__ We learned in the previous section that the task of classification is to assign\n",
    " categorical, unordered labels to instances. A second type of supervised learning is\n",
    " the prediction of continuous outcomes, which is also called regression analysis. In\n",
    " regression analysis, we are given a number of predictor (explanatory) variables and\n",
    " a continuous response variable (outcome or target), and we try to find a relationship\n",
    " between those variables that allows us to predict an outcome.\n",
    " For example, let's assume that we are interested in predicting the math SAT scores of\n",
    " our students. If there is a relationship between the time spent studying for the test\n",
    " and the final scores, we could use it as training data to learn a model that uses the\n",
    " study time to predict the test scores of future students who are planning to take this\n",
    " test __"
